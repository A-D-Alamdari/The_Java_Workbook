    Exercise 3:Area of a Room

    Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once
    the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the
    room. The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include
    units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which
    unit you are more comfortable working with.
